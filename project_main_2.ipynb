Tonight it's currently 25C and it's very uncomfortable. Today is set to be 37C in my area in the Midlands. That's unbelievable. Climate change is here and it's staring us in the face. This is most likely a taste of the future to come. And just remember that inate change will not just be about hot sunny days in the UK. We can look forward to more extreme flooding. We've already seen this for gods sake. People on social media are flat out in utter denial about the seriousness of the situation.

How do we know when we've done enough? Is the goal to try to pin down the climate to what it is now? Is the goal to end the cycle of warming and icing? Do we have to prevent ice ages from happening in the future, or do we have to allow the earth to go through another one despite the damage it would do?

Aridification will destroy protein farming and agriculture all around the world, except in NZ which has elevation, soil fertility and abundant freshwater. It's more likely that climate change will make agriculture and some types of horticulture much more profitable in NZ, even if globally meat and dairy consumption decreases.

I don't need a kid with a sign stealing my time to be aware of the uncomfortable truth. These protests are so blind to what people actually feel. The people they are protesting against (like me) feel powerless to do anything. So of course we would be angry when confronted with a protest that is angry with us for not changing climate policy. I'm one of the few people who voted green every election. There isn't much more I can do unfortunately.

You are speaking from a position of incredible privelege.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |-0.4767  |1    |\n",

The patterns Neural networks recognise are obviously beyond our comprehension in most cases, but developers are also programming methods for the neural networks to explain the general direction of the patterns the networks are picking up on, like highlighting pixels of images that the networks consider to be of most weight in decision making to place in one category or the other. The idea being that we can in fact learn and gain new knowledge about things from sort of reverse engineering the network to spill the beans. I believe such techniques are being used in the cutting edge of physics, chemistry and biology as we speak. I personally think this is really exciting, that we’re almost at a point AI will help us solve massive problems and make new discoveries on a daily basis. Think finding the cure for cancer or solving climate change.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |0.8977   |2    |\n",

Telling people not to have a realistic expectation of the billionaires and politicians contributing to climate destruction isn’t apathetic. Congratulating minimal progress is significantly more apathetic to the fact that we are in a crisis. We do not need unfounded optimism. Be glad that there is some change; be angry it isn’t more. That’s not derisive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |-0.8991  |1    |\n",

      "|comment|hktsm61|2qh16       |technology    |false         |1637047026 |Dang, I thought we were getting close to you understanding me. Instead you want to stick with the thought patterns that make you feel comfortable, even if they don't align with reality. Honestly I do recognize that the phenomenon I'm describing might not apply on a macro scale. Which is why in the very first comment that you responded to, I said that we still don't know if Bitcoin will be net carbon positive or negative. If we can fully determine that it will be carbon positive, I will definitely be less supportive of it. This is the difference between you and me. I'm willing to change my stance based on the evidence. It seems like you only want to further bolster your own understanding of the world, regardless of what the evidence says. Climate change really is the most important issue to me, so I'm extremely open to trying to understand the idea that crypto can't fit into a renewable energy future. But so far you have not given me any indication that my prior understanding is incorrect. Am I wrong in thinking that you finally understand how my individual situation does 100% lead to less carbon being put into the atmosphere? Now my concern is if that really does scale into a macro level, or if my utility company is actually charging less than the reasonable rate to allow me to use renewable energy. I fully accept the idea that this might not work on a larger scale. If that is the case, then it deals a huge blow to my personal feelings toward crypto. I'm honestly a very reasonable person, and the most important thing to me is the truth. I will definitely start to oppose crypto if I start to believe that the negatives outweigh the positives. But one thing to point out... is that i graduated at the top of my class in finance. I was literally the student with the best grades graduating with my major in my college. So I think that i have a pretty good understanding of the financial aspect of this discussion.|0.9933   |1    |\n",

The logic that native vegetation that adapted requiring fire for germination  suggests that the wildfire cycles have been longstanding due to the speed of adaptation. I'm not saying climate change isn't exacerbating it or that it doesn't exist but it's still a natural cycle for there to be adapted native vegetation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |0.3818   |1    |\n",

We should be laser-focusing on the environment and climate change.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |-0.8936  |2    |\n",

The best they could is use it *in response* to a climate emergency because it does extend to natural disasters, but my understanding of the law is that they couldn't use it to preempt climate change by forcing producers to use, say, environmentally friendly production processes, or to import from nations with success in reducing emissions or whatever. That would be a huge overstep of government authority and would be challenged for sure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |0.9709   |1    |\n",

It’s either nuclear and renewables or gas and renewables. Fukushima is absolutely nothing compared to, you know, climate change. You can’t just pick between renewables and nuclear, it doesn’t work like that. Renewables aren’t capable of producing baseload energy so the benefits are absolutely greater than the risks                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |0.9131   |3    |\n",

Among many amazing things about them, fossil fuels are very energy dense, and they are also stable in the earth. Other energy sources have to be installed and removed perpetually, and basically none of them can e.g. drive shafts without a motor. We can certainly do better than we're doing now, but climate change is inevitable, there are just too many people living lives that are too comfortable. We will also never address climate change in a democracy, because the solutions which would make the most amount of difference are not palatable so nobody will ever vote for them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |0.9213   |1    |\n",

I’m sure she has some good intentions, but she’s not a good rep. She’s not the best speaker, bit of a know it all bully and only won her seat because she knew how to use social media better than her opponents. Not sure if she’s really accomplished anything yet except irritate GOP and her own party, but I do consistently hear that she has great tits so there’s that.

And your 6 day old account is a fun coincidence?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |0.925    |0    |\n",

      "|comment|fzypuu4|2qh16       |technology    |false         |1596266303 |A new Cold War is definitely brewing between the US and China. Seems like we're headed toward a more multi-polar world in general with the US, China, and EU each controlling their own separate spheres of influence. This, along with climate change soon to rear it's ugly head, spells difficult times ahead for humanity. Practically the whole world being so intertwined economically has been almost entirely the reason why we've avoided major scale wars since the end of WWII. A fractured and dis-unified world is the tinder, and climate change along with the subsequent population displacement and resource scarcity is the fire needed to burn the whole world down. I'm not so sure humanity is going to make it, at least not the way it is now.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |-0.9398  |-1   |\n",

I fucking hate Biden to the core of my being, but allowing Trump to take office again would be 1000x worse. It would make the job of any future dem president near impossible, and it’s likely much of the damage he would cause in regards to climate change would be undoable. And if you think he was wreckless this term, imagine after being exonerated of his previous crimes and knowing he doesn’t have another term to run for. If you don’t vote you’re really missing the big picture of how the system works.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |-0.876   |3    |\n",

Bezos crated a world where a 5$ widget gets flown by plane from China to be delivered thousands of miles away in the USA only to break, be thrown away or be forgotten. Fuel, packaging.. just waste all the way down the line. I can’t take BeZos seriously on any front when it comes to the environment. His company’s  policies encourage waste every step of the way all in the name of customer satisfaction. He has created a entire marketplace of petulant children who indiscriminately buy, break, return, throw away with no though to the real cost of his policies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |-0.128   |1    |\n",

The climate is always changing and that is proven easily with temperature recordings. The real debate is about the causes of climate change, whether it's man-made to a large extent OR natural to a large-extent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |0.8455   |0    |\n",

Ajit Pai is sucking massive ISP cock right now, and that will never change until he's fired by the next administration. If you really want to stop them, you have to do exactly what /r/gaming did to EA: stop buying products from the companies that are opposed to NN. That means cutting the cord with your ISP.  Comcast is the only game in town, and you don't want to miss the next episode of your favorite show? Well then, have fun with bandwidth throttling, because by continuing to purchase services from the very companies you despise, you prove to them that you're willing to live with the anal rape that they're planning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |-0.835   |0    |\n",

How much is it going to cost to address climate change and how much worse are we making it by not including a carbon tax to integrate the costs into the production of coal, natural gas, and oil?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |-0.7269  |1    |\n",

This discussion isn't about natural climate change, which almost everyone understands and accepts.  It's about global warming. Global warming implies unnatural man made climate change and thus far nobody has been able to prove it even exists.

There's always a timeframe set that climate change will tear the world apart, conveniently at a time long enough that the article itself will be long buried in archives once that time is actually here.  We've gone from armageddon within 20 years to the state of Florida going underwater in 2100.  The fact remains that it's all theory, and so we'd be better off teaching the science used to formulate these hypotheses before preaching something we can only speculate the details of.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |-0.3041  |-4   |\n",

Nuclear energy would be a massive help but green energy advocates somehow like it even less than fossil fuels.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |0.8338   |18   |\n",

I'm of course for things like being pro-choice, though abortion doesn't impact me personally, so it's not my \\#1 voting issue. Republicans would probably call me a libtard, democrats would probably call me a fascist.

Second, while I look forward to her tenure on the court, we've already seen voting rights gutted, a majority of Republicans STILL don't believe Biden won the election and the MAGA electors are in place to do what the 2020 Republicans would not, throw votes in the trash. Manchin is key to killing any legislation that will stem climate change, a woman's right to her own health, support for families with children and on and on.  So forgive me for thinking that the hellscape Manchian helped create and the fossil fuel stranglehold on this nation is a fair trade for a justice that won't make a damned difference with the MAGA majority on the court. \"\"Yes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | please give me strawberries on my shit salad.\"\"\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |0.6402                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n",

And yes, the electric car market can shut down. Putting the responsibility of climate change and the use of fossil fuels on regular people by needing to buy an $80k electric car that's made entirely of plastic, has batteries that are unable to be recycled, and maintenance that is monopolistic and expensive is not the solution.

The biggest problem with nuclear energy is that it's fucking expensive and takes forever to get a plant into operation.

The current administration has made the Department of the Interior cancel 1,000's of leases, and restricted oil field capacity on Federal Land by about 25%. Our stateside drilling capacity is down about 20% from 2019 levels. ( Obviously we're not going to use 2020...) At these higher prices, these domestic oil companies would love to be pumping more oil,but they can't. Factor in some turbulence in Russia, and the futures skyrocket. ( Oil is the most fragile commodity pricewise... ) One other thing to factor in: apparently 6 refineries shut down a couple of years ago in the U.S. , and only one has reopened so far. That's a huge contributor to at-the-pump pricing. ALso, a lot of states have a percentage gas tax rather then a per-unit tax, so that grows along with the base price at a higher rate.

Natural warming and cooling in the past does see co2 change after initial warming given there werent gigatons of co2 released in industrial activity back then, with co2 levels driving temperatures up or down respectively in feedback loops over the course of thousands of years. Co2 is not only not lagging temperatures, and hasn't been since modern warming started, levels are increasing at rates not seen in prior warming cycles back to mass extinction events. Rates that cannot be explained away by things like increased solar forcing or Milankovich cycles etc etc alone. As the other commenter noted, it is an incredibly complex topic, and yes its not just possible but an obvious reality that human activity isnt the only driver in climate, BUT it is absolutely the PRIMARY driver far and away in causing current co2 emissions and associated warming. Skepticism from questioning the overdramatic fear mongering of politicians like Al Gore is understandable but your \"\"questions\"\" and post history make it obvious that's not where your skepticism ends.
